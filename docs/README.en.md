`MTGA_GUI.app` will be automatically processed and launched

### CLI Solution

1. Locate the full path of `MTGA_GUI.app`, e.g., `/Applications/MTGA_GUI.app`.
2. Open the Terminal application.
3. Run the following command to remove the signature quarantine from `MTGA_GUI.app`:
   ```zsh
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <full path of the app>
   ```
   This removes the `com.apple.quarantine` extended attribute from `MTGA_GUI.app`.
4. Launch `MTGA_GUI.app`.

## Troubleshooting 'Add Model Failed' Prompt on Trae Side

Please check:

- Whether the hosts file contains the line `127.0.0.1 api.openai.com`, and that it is not commented out (starting with #).
- Ensure no other programs are using port 443 (such as browsers, VPNs, etc.).
  - You can check using the following commands:

    ```
    # windows
    netstat -ano | find ":443" | find "LISTENING"

    # macos
    netstat -lnp tcp | grep :443
    ```

  - If there is a process listening on port 443, it is recommended to close that process.

## Starting from Script

### Step 0: Environment Preparation

#### Windows

- System requirements: Windows 10 or above
- Administrator privileges required
- Install Python environment, recommended Python 3.10 or above
- Install Git

##### Step 1: Generate a Self-Signed Certificate

Open Git Bash:

```bash
# Change to the ca directory
cd "mtga/ca"

# 1. Generate the CA certificate (ca.crt and ca.key)
./genca.sh
```

When executing `./genca.sh`, it will ask "Do you want to generate ca cert and key? [yes/no]". Enter `y` and press Enter. Afterwards, it will prompt for some information:

- `Country Name (2 letter code) []`: Enter `CN` (or another country code)
- Other fields (like State, Locality, Organization, Common Name for CA) can be filled as needed or left blank; it's suggested to fill them with `X`. The Common Name can be something like `MTGA_CA`. The email field can be left empty.

```bash
# 2. Generate the SSL certificate for api.openai.com (api.openai.com.crt and api.openai.com.key)
# This script uses the configuration files api.openai.com.subj and api.openai.com.cnf in the same directory
./gencrt.sh api.openai.com
```

After execution completes, you will find the following important files in the `mtga\ca` directory:

- `ca.crt` (Your custom CA certificate)
- `ca.key` (Your custom CA private key - **DO NOT LEAK**)
- `api.openai.com.crt` (SSL certificate for the local proxy server)
- `api.openai.com.key` (SSL private key for the local proxy server - **DO NOT LEAK**)

##### Step 2: Make Windows Trust Your CA Certificate

1.  Locate the `mtga\ca\ca.crt` file.
2.  Double-click the `ca.crt` file to open the certificate viewer.
3.  Click the "Install Certificate..." button.
4.  Choose "Current User" or "Local Machine". It is recommended to choose "Local Machine" (this requires administrator privileges) to apply it to all users.
5.  In the next dialog, select "Place all certificates in the following store", then click "Browse...".
6.  Select "Trusted Root Certification Authorities", then click "OK".
7.  Click "Next", then "Finish". If a security warning pops up, select "Yes".

##### Step 3: Modify the Hosts File

**⚠️WARNING: After performing this step, you will not be able to access the original OpenAI API. Web usage is unaffected.**

You need to modify the Hosts file with administrator privileges to point `api.openai.com` to your local machine.

1.  Hosts file path: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
2.  Open this file with Notepad (or another text editor) as an administrator.
3.  Add the following line at the end of the file:
    ```
    127.0.0.1 api.openai.com
    ```
4.  Save the file.

##### Step 4: Run the Local Proxy Server (Python)

**Before running the proxy server:**

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask requests
    ```
2.  **Configure the Script**:
    - Open the `trae_proxy.py` file.
    - **Modify `TARGET_API_BASE_URL`**: Replace it with the base URL of the actual OpenAI-format API site you want to connect to (e.g., `"https://your-api.example.com"`).
    - **Confirm Certificate Paths**: The script defaults to reading `api.openai.com.crt` and `api.openai.com.key` from `mtga\ca`. If your certificates are not in this path, modify the values of `CERT_FILE` and `KEY_FILE`, or copy these two files to the `CERT_DIR` specified by the script.

**Run the Proxy Server:**

Open Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell **Run as Administrator** (because it needs to listen on port 443), then execute:

```bash
python trae_proxy.py
```

If everything goes well, you should see the server startup logs.

##### Step 5: Configure Trae IDE

1.  Open and log in to Trae IDE.
2.  In the AI dialog box, click the model icon in the lower right corner and select "Add Model" at the end.
3.  **Provider**: Select `OpenAI`.
4.  **Model**: Select "Custom Model".
5.  **Model ID**: Enter the value you defined for `CUSTOM_MODEL_ID` in the Python script (e.g., `my-custom-local-model`).
6.  **API Key**:
    - If your target API requires an API key and Trae will pass it via `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, then the key entered here will be forwarded by the Python proxy.
    - When configuring OpenAI in Trae, the API key is related to the `remove_reasoning_content` configuration. Our Python proxy does not handle this logic; it simply forwards the Authorization header. You can try entering the key required by your target API, or an arbitrary key in the `sk-xxxx` format.

7.  Click "Add Model".
8.  Return to the AI chat box and select the custom model you just added from the lower right corner.

Now, when you interact with this custom model through Trae, the requests should go through your local Python proxy and be forwarded to your configured `TARGET_API_BASE_URL`.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**

- **Port Conflict**: If port 443 is already occupied (e.g., by IIS, Skype, or other services), the Python script will fail to start. You need to stop the service occupying that port, or modify the Python script and Nginx (if used) to listen on a different port (though this is more complex because Trae hardcodes access to `https://api.openai.com` on port 443).
- **Firewall**: Ensure the Windows firewall allows inbound connections for Python listening on port 443 (even though it's a local connection `127.0.0.1`, firewall configuration is usually not required, but it's worth checking).
- **Certificate Issues**: If Trae reports SSL/TLS related errors, carefully check if the CA certificate has been correctly installed into the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" store, and if the Python proxy correctly loaded `api.openai.com.crt` and `.key`.
- **Proxy Logs**: The Python script will print some logs that can help you diagnose issues.

This solution is more integrated than the direct vproxy + nginx approach, placing both TLS termination and proxy logic within a single Python script, making it more suitable for rapid prototyping on Windows.
